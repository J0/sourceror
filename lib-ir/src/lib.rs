/**
 * The structs here represent the intermediate representation of the program.
 * In particular:
 * * All variables are represented with the location it should be read/written to (i.e. local#1.var#1, or local#1.var#1.var#1, or global#1).
 * * Note: A param is implicitly a local (with the same index space), and param indices preceed the local indices.
 * * Note: Params may also be modified (just like locals and globals).  They do not affect the value in the caller (because of pass-by-value).
 * * All expressions have optional type annotation (which will be `any` for now).
 * * All functions are top level and don't have closures (the closure is just treated as another parameter).
 * * Top level code are put in the entry point function.
 * *
 * * There are no constant/variable declarations - semantic analyser should hoist all declarations:
 * * Semantic analyser should generate a struct to put all 'local variables' into, and place this struct in Func::locals.  Same for global variables, put them in a single struct that is in Program::globals.
 * * If params need to be captured, semantic analyser should copy them into the struct too.
 * * IR optimisation passes might pull out fields and put them in separate local variables (can create a new struct type so we don't disturb the old one, then dead code elimination can remove the old struct).
 * * There is no difference between constant declarations and variable declarations in the IR.
 * *
 * * Pre-generated functions can be something like `+(any, any) -> any`, which will internally query the type of its arguments and then forward it to the `Add` primitive or the builtin concat(string, string) function.
